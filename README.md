## power-consumption-prediction

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Power+consumption+of+Tetouan+city) related to power consumption of three different distribution networks of Tetouan city which is located in north Morocco is used for analysis and the dataset doesnot contain any missing values. Firstly, the relative importance of each feature is calculated using SelectKbest and Permutation Importance. Since, its regression problem, following metrics were used for measuring the performance of the model:

- Mean Absolute Error 
- Root Mean Squared Error
- Mean Squared Error 
- R-Squared 
- Scatter-Plot (Visual Evaluation)

In this work, listed below algorithms were used for building the model:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Adaboost
- Xgboost

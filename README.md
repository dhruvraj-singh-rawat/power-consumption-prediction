## power-consumption-prediction

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Power+consumption+of+Tetouan+city) related to power consumption of three different distribution networks of Tetouan city which is located in north Morocco is used for analysis. 

Relative importance of each feature is calculated using SelectKbest and Permutation Importance. 

Following metrics were used for measuring the performance of the model:

- Mean Absolute Error 
- Root Mean Squared Error
- Mean Squared Error 
- R-Squared 
- Scatter-Plot (Visual Evaluation)


In the work, listed below algorithms were used in the analysis:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Adaboost
- Xgboost
